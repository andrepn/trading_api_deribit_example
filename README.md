# trading_api_deribit_example

deribit_v1_api is the more developed version that employs logic currently on the production deribit site.

A python program using deribit v1 api to maintain limit orders around the current price. [not a trading strategy or advice, use pieces at your own risk]

This is an example pulling data from deribit v1 api and using that data to place trades. 

Then listening for trades to happen or price to move and making adjustments accordingly.

Lots of updates were done offline. This version is not completely functional (for profitability) but contains all the basic mechanics!
